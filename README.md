👋 Hi, I’m @Rahul

👀 I’m interested in building scalable, high-performance web applications using the .NET tech stack, including ASP.NET, MVC, .NET Core, and SQL Server. I also enjoy working with front-end technologies like Angular to create seamless user experiences.

🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced topics in .NET Core, Web APIs, and cloud-based solutions to build better, more efficient applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving full-stack development, enterprise web applications, and backend optimization using .NET technologies. I am open to contributing to open-source projects and team-driven development environments.
